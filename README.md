# Background

I was a self-taught web developer since I was in high school. I code for fun and little money. After graduation with a bachelor of business. But I've decided to embrace my dream career as my web developer in 2014. I've moved to Melbourne, Australia in 2016 that where my career really takes off. I work as a full-stack engineer in Australia since 2016, but frontend is always my main forte.
